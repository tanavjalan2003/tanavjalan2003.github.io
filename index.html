                        <p>I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Tanav Jalan, whom I've supervised since August 2023 as a Subject Area tutor for Academic Support Network (ASN). He consistently exhibits exceptional domain knowledge, leadership qualities, and effective teamwork skills in his role.
                            As a Subject Area Tutor, Tanav's key responsibilities include providing virtual and in-person assistance to ASU students and developing instructional materials for ASN's Online Study Hub. Currently, Tanav tutors an average of 30 students weekly in a variety of advanced subjects including Mathematics, Chemistry, Statistics, and Physics. From August 2023 – May 2024, Tanav has already answered 1360 questions for approximately 480 students. Moreover, displaying his praiseworthy interpersonal skills, he has succeeded in establishing rapport with his colleagues, working harmoniously alongside 100 subject area tutors, 50 Desk Aides, and 20 ASU professional staff members. Since our initial interaction in August of 2023, I have witnessed Tanav's incredible career progression, showcasing an increased drive for success and commitment to achieving desired outcomes.
                            Please do not hesitate to write to me at the email mentioned above if you have any questions about my recommendation. I’ll be happy to address any further queries regarding Tanav."</p>

                        <p>"To whom it may concern,</p> 
                        <p>Tanav worked as a UGTA (Undergraduate Teaching Assistant) for my FSE150 Perspectives on Grand Challenges for Engineering course during Fall 2022. Tanav was very motivated and highly responsible. Team formation for the course team project is always challenging due to its open-endedness, the team size limit, and that team formation is based on students' interests. 
                            Tanav was extremely helpful during this process, providing great guidance to students to ensure that everyone in the class was placed in a team that they were satisfied with. 
                            Throughout the semester, Tanav also did a fantastic job interacting with students during classes for this active learning and discussion-based course, making sure that students fully understood the class activities and actively participated in the activities and discussions. He also provided great help and guidance to the teams on their team projects. Overall, Tanav wasn't someone who just passively completed the tasks required, instead, he took the intitative and had ownership of his role as the UGTA, doing an excellent job.</p>
